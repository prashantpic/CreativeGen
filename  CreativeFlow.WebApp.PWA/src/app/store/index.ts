/**
 * @file This file serves as a central hub for exporting all Zustand state management stores.
 * By exporting them from a single file, we can simplify imports in other parts of the application.
 * Instead of importing from individual slice files, components can import all necessary stores
 * from '@/app/store'.
 *
 * Example:
 * import { useAuthStore, useProjectStore } from '@/app/store';
