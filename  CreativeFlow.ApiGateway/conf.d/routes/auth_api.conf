# CreativeFlow: API Gateway - Authentication Service Routes
#
# Description: This configuration file routes all authentication and authorization
# related API requests to the dedicated upstream 'auth_service'.
# These endpoints are generally public (e.g., login, register) and are
# rate-limited to prevent abuse.
#

location /api/v1/auth/ {
    # Rate limit requests to prevent brute-force attacks on login/register endpoints.
    # The 'per_ip_general' zone is assumed to be defined in a global policy file
    # (e.g., 03-rate_limiting_policies.conf).
    limit_req zone=per_ip_general burst=10 nodelay;

    # Pass the request to the 'auth_service' upstream group.
    # The upstream is defined in '02-upstreams.conf'.
    # The trailing slash on the proxy_pass URL is important. It ensures that if the
    # incoming request is for /api/v1/auth/login, it gets passed to the upstream as
    # http://auth_service/api/v1/auth/login.
    proxy_pass http://auth_service;

    # Include common proxy settings from the shared configuration file.
    # This sets headers like X-Forwarded-For, Host, etc.
