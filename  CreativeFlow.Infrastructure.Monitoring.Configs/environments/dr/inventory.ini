# Inventory for the Disaster Recovery (DR) environment.
# Define host groups and the hosts belonging to them.
# This inventory should mirror the production structure for critical services.

# Example:
# [all_servers:children]
# web_servers
# db_replicas # In DR, this would be the replica to be promoted

# [web_servers]
# dr-web-01.dr.creativeflow.ai ansible_host=10.2.1.10

# [db_replicas]
# dr-db-01.dr.creativeflow.ai ansible_host=10.2.1.20
