# Role to install and configure Odoo application and dependencies.
# This is a placeholder implementation. A full implementation would handle:
# - Installing Python and PostgreSQL client libraries.
# - Installing OS-level dependencies for Odoo (e.g., libsasl2-dev, libldap2-dev).
# - Cloning the Odoo source code from a git repository.
# - Installing Python dependencies using pip from a requirements.txt file.
# - Creating a dedicated system user for Odoo.
# - Creating a configuration file (odoo.conf) from a template.
# - Setting up a systemd service to run Odoo.
# - Configuring a reverse proxy (likely in the nginx_lb role).
