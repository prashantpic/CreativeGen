# Role to install and configure n8n application and dependencies.
# This is a placeholder implementation. A full implementation would handle:
# - Installing Node.js.
# - Installing n8n using npm.
# - Creating a dedicated system user.
# - Creating configuration files/environment variables for database connections, etc.
# - Setting up a systemd service to run n8n.
# - Configuring a reverse proxy (likely in the nginx_lb role).
