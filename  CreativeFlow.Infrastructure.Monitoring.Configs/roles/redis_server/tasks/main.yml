# Role to install and configure Redis server.
# This is a placeholder implementation. A full implementation would handle:
# - Installing the Redis server package.
# - Managing the redis.conf file via a template to configure bind address, port, password, persistence, etc.
# - Ensuring the redis-server service is started and enabled.
# - Potentially configuring Redis Sentinel for high availability.
