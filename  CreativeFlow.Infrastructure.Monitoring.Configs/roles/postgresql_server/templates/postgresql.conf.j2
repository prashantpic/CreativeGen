# -----------------------------
# PostgreSQL configuration file
# -----------------------------

# This is a sample file. A production file would have many more
# settings tuned for performance (shared_buffers, effective_cache_size, etc.)

# --- Connections and Authentication ---
listen_addresses = '*'
port = {{ pg_port }}
max_connections = 100

# --- Write-Ahead Log ---
wal_level = {{ pg_wal_level }}
max_wal_senders = {{ pg_max_wal_senders }}
wal_keep_size = {{ pg_wal_keep_segments * 16 }}MB # wal_keep_segments is deprecated in newer PG versions

# --- Replication ---
# These settings are primarily for the primary server
# hot_standby = on # On replicas, this is on by default if in recovery

# --- Logging ---
# log_destination = 'stderr'
# logging_collector = on
# log_directory = 'log'
# log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'
# log_statement = 'ddl'
