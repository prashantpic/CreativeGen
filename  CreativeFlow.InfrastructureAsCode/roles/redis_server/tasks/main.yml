# Role to install and configure Redis server.
# This is a placeholder. A full implementation would include:
# 1. Installing the redis-server package.
# 2. Templating the redis.conf configuration file to set bind address,
#    port, password (from vault), persistence options, etc.
# 3. Ensuring the Redis service is started and enabled.
# 4. (Optional) For clustering/sentinel setup, additional configuration would be needed.
