#
# Inventory for the Disaster Recovery (DR) Environment
#
# This inventory defines the hosts at the DR site. It should mirror the
# critical host groups from the production environment to allow for a
# consistent failover process using the same playbooks.
#
# Example:
# [web_servers]
# dr-web-01.dr.creativeflow.ai ansible_host=10.10.1.10
#
# [db_replicas] # Will be promoted to primary during a DR event
# dr-db-01.dr.creativeflow.ai ansible_host=10.10.3.10
#

[all_servers:children]

n8n_servers
db_replicas # Initially replicas, promoted during failover

[db_primary]
# This group should be empty in the DR inventory initially.
# The DR failover playbook will manage promoting a replica.
