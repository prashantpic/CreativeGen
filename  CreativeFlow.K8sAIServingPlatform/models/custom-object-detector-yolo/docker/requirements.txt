# This file lists Python dependencies required specifically for the YOLO model,
# on top of the base FastAPI requirements.

# Core ML/DL framework
torch>=2.0.0,<2.3.0
torchvision>=0.15.0,<0.18.0

# Library for easy use of YOLO models.
# This single package is often sufficient for recent YOLO versions (v8+).
# For older versions (like v5), you might need to install from a git repo
# or a different set of packages.
ultralytics>=8.0.0,<8.2.0

# Required for image processing (reading, resizing, etc.)
opencv-python-headless>=4.5.0,<4.10.0
Pillow>=9.0.0,<10.4.0

# Note: Review dependencies based on the exact YOLO version and how it's loaded.
# If using `torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', ...)` you might need additional
# dependencies like `pyyaml` and `pandas`. The `ultralytics` package usually
# handles these dependencies itself.
