# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CreativeFlow.ApiGateway.Nginx


---

# 2. Description
The central API Gateway for CreativeFlow AI, implemented using Nginx (potentially with OpenResty/Lua for advanced logic). It serves as the single entry point for all client requests (web, mobile, third-party API users). Responsibilities include request routing to backend microservices, JWT authentication/authorization token validation, rate limiting, API key validation, SSL termination, and request/response transformation. This component is crucial for decoupling clients from the internal microservice architecture.
