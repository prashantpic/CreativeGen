# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CreativeFlow.Service.Collaboration


---

# 2. Description
Backend service enabling real-time collaborative editing on creative projects. It manages WebSocket connections for collaborative sessions, utilizes Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) like Yjs to synchronize changes between multiple users, and handles merging of offline edits for collaborative projects upon reconnection. It persists significant changes or consolidated states to the primary database (PostgreSQL) and maintains change history for auditing. This service is crucial for the 'collaboration-friendly' aspect of the platform.
