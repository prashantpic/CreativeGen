# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CreativeFlow.K8sAIServingPlatform


---

# 2. Description
The GPU-accelerated AI model serving platform, orchestrated by Kubernetes. This repository conceptually covers the Kubernetes manifests, Docker images for custom AI models, and configurations for model serving runtimes (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Triton Inference Server). It provides the execution environment for custom AI models and is managed by the MLOps service for deployments. It receives jobs typically orchestrated by n8n.
