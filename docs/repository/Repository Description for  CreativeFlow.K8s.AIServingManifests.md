# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CreativeFlow.K8s.AIServingManifests


---

# 2. Description
This repository contains Kubernetes manifests (YAML) for deploying and managing AI models on the GPU-accelerated AI processing cluster (Section 2.4, DEP-001). This includes Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets (placeholders, actual values from Vault), and potentially custom resource definitions related to AI model serving. It also includes Dockerfiles for containerizing custom AI models (INT-007) and configurations for model serving runtimes like TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, or Triton Inference Server.
