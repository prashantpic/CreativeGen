# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CreativeFlow.Shared.BackendLibraries


---

# 2. Description
This repository houses shared Python libraries and utility functions used by multiple backend microservices (e.g., AI Generation Orchestrator, API Platform Service, Notification Service). This can include common data transfer objects (DTOs), validation logic, error handling classes, client wrappers for internal services, database interaction helpers (if not fully encapsulated in services), or any other cross-cutting concerns that are not specific to a single service. The aim is to promote code reuse, consistency, and reduce boilerplate across the backend services, aligning with NFR-008 (Code Quality) and NFR-009 (Modularity).
