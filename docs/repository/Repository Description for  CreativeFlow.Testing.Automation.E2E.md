# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CreativeFlow.Testing.Automation.E2E


---

# 2. Description
This repository contains all automated end-to-end (E2E) test scripts for critical user journeys on the CreativeFlow AI platform (QA-001). It uses frameworks like Cypress or Playwright for web application testing, and Appium or Flutter integration tests for mobile application testing. It also includes performance testing scripts (using k6, JMeter, or Locust) to validate NFRs (NFR-001, NFR-002). These tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
