# Software Design Specification (SDS) for CreativeFlow.Shared.UIComponents

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the software design for the `CreativeFlow.Shared.UIComponents` repository. This repository serves as a centralized UI component library, or Design System, for the CreativeFlow AI platform. Its primary purpose is to ensure a consistent, maintainable, and high-quality user experience across all frontend applications, including the React-based Progressive Web App (PWA) and the Flutter-based native mobile apps.

This is achieved through a monorepo structure containing three core packages:
1.  **`@creativeflow/design-tokens`**: The single source of truth for all stylistic properties.
2.  **`@creativeflow/react-ui`**: A library of reusable UI components for the React web application.
3.  **`creative_flow_ui`**: A library of reusable widgets for the Flutter mobile applications.

This design adheres to requirement **NFR-007** (Consistent design language and interaction patterns).

## 2. Architectural Overview

The repository is structured as a **monorepo** managed by **Lerna** or a similar tool (e.g., Turborepo). This approach facilitates code sharing, centralized dependency management, and streamlined build/test processes.

The core architectural pattern is **Design Tokens**. A platform-agnostic set of design decisions (colors, spacing, typography) is defined in JSON files. A build process transforms these tokens into platform-specific formats (SCSS variables for web, Dart constants for mobile), which are then consumed by the respective component libraries.
