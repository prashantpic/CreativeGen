# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CreativeFlow.ApiGateway


---

# 2. Description
The central API Gateway for CreativeFlow AI, implemented using Nginx. It serves as the single entry point for all client requests (web, mobile, third-party API users). Responsibilities include request routing to backend microservices, JWT authentication/authorization, rate limiting, API key validation, SSL termination, and potentially basic request/response transformations. This component is crucial for decoupling clients from the internal microservice architecture.
