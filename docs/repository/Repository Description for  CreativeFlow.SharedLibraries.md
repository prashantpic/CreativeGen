# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CreativeFlow.SharedLibraries


---

# 2. Description
A collection of shared libraries and common utilities used across multiple backend microservices. This includes modules for standardized logging, security helpers (input validation, output encoding), internationalization utilities (date/time/number formatting), common data transfer objects (DTOs) if applicable, and error handling frameworks. These libraries promote code reuse and consistency.
