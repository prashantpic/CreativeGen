- Mobile app launch time (cold start to interactive): < 3 seconds (P90)

#### 4.1.2 Throughput
**NFR-002**: System capacity
- Support 10,000 concurrent users (target metric to be achieved through progressive scaling of infrastructure, particularly the AI processing cluster)
- Process 1,000 generation requests per minute (target metric leveraging scalable GPU orchestration, to be achieved through progressive scaling of the AI processing cluster)
- Handle 100,000 daily active users
- Scale to 1M registered users within the first two years of operation.

### 4.2 Availability and Reliability
**NFR-003**: System uptime
- 99.9% availability for core services (excluding planned maintenance), equating to approximately 8.76 hours of unscheduled downtime per year.
- Planned maintenance windows communicated at least 48 hours in advance, scheduled during low-usage periods (e.g., weekends, early morning UTC), as per organizational policy.
- Graceful degradation of non-critical features during high load or partial system outages.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Critical services (user authentication, core creative generation path, subscription management) shall have an RTO of 4 hours.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: User data (profiles, projects, generated assets) and critical system state shall have an RPO of 15 minutes.

**NFR-004**: Fault tolerance
- Automatic failover for critical services (web servers, API gateway, Odoo backend, n8n, database, message queues, notification service).
- Data replication across multiple availability zones. For the self-hosted infrastructure, "multiple availability zones" refers to physically distinct server racks with independent power and network paths within the same data center, and ideally, replication to a secondary data center for disaster recovery.
    - **PostgreSQL Replication**: Streaming replication will be used. For critical user data and configurations, synchronous commit to at least one replica in a different local zone will be enforced. Asynchronous replication will be used for the DR site.
    - **MinIO Replication**: Active-active multi-site replication will be configured between local availability zones. Asynchronous bucket replication will be used for the DR site.
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing (at least quarterly), validating RPO/RTO targets, using automated backup tools and scripts. Test results and remediation actions will be documented as per organizational policy.

### 4.3 Scalability
**NFR-005**: Horizontal and Vertical Scaling Capabilities
- Auto-scaling based on demand for stateless services (web/API servers, Notification Service) and AI processing units, managed by Kubernetes (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Cluster Autoscaler).
- Load balancing across multiple servers (Nginx or equivalent).
- Database scalability through read replicas, connection pooling, and optimized queries. Vertical scaling of the primary database server will be the initial approach, with strategies for sharding or transitioning to distributed SQL databases (e.g., CockroachDB, YugabyteDB) planned if future growth necessitates beyond read replicas and vertical scaling limits.
- CDN integration (Cloudflare) for global performance and offloading static asset delivery.
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks (e.g., AI generation, bulk exports) via message queues (RabbitMQ) to ensure system responsiveness.

### 4.4 Security and Privacy
**NFR-006**: Data protection
- Strong encryption in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest (AES-256) for all sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, API keys, and payment details.
- Data processed by internally hosted and managed server-side AI components will be handled within a secure processing environment. This environment will employ:
    - Strict process and memory isolation using containerization technologies (Docker, with exploration of Kata Containers for enhanced isolation) on GPU workers.
    - Network segmentation to limit data exposure during processing.
    - Where feasible and supported by hardware, confidential computing technologies (e.g., AMD SEV, Intel SGX) may be explored for enhanced memory protection during AI model execution.
    - For Enterprise tier users, options for dedicated GPU resources or processing instances will be evaluated to ensure data segregation.
    - All access to data within this environment will be based on fine-grained access controls and robustly audited.
For data processed by third-party AI services (as per INT-005), the platform will ensure secure data transit to these services and robust API key management (as per INT-006); however, the processing of data by these external services is subject to their respective security and privacy policies. Users will be clearly informed when their data is being processed by such external services, as per platform Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
- GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 (Type II) compliance targets. The system will be designed and audited to meet these standards.
- Regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing (at least annually and after major system changes).
- Implementation of a zero-trust security model where practical, verifying every access request.
- Adherence to data retention policies as defined in Section 7.5.

### 4.5 Usability
**NFR-007**: User experience standards
- Mobile-first responsive design for the web application.
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) for web and mobile applications.
- Maximum 3-click access to core functions from the main dashboard or relevant context.
- Contextual help, tooltips, and clear affordances throughout the interface.
- Consistent design language and interaction patterns across web and mobile platforms.

### 4.6 Maintainability Requirements

**NFR-008**: Code Quality and Conventions
- All code shall adhere to established style guides and best practices for the respective languages and frameworks (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint/Prettier for TypeScript/JavaScript, effective Dart for Dart).
- Code shall be well-commented, especially for complex logic, public APIs, and configuration settings. Comments should explain 'why', not just 'what'.
- Automated linting and static analysis tools (as mentioned in QA-001, QA-002) shall be integrated into the CI pipeline to enforce code quality and identify potential issues early.

**NFR-009**: Modularity and Decoupling
- The system shall be designed with modular components and well-defined interfaces (APIs) to promote loose coupling and high cohesion within modules.
- Microservices and backend modules (e.g., Odoo custom modules, n8n workflows, Notification Service) should be independently deployable and scalable where feasible and architecturally sound.
- Dependencies between modules should be minimized, clearly documented, and managed (e.g., using semantic versioning for internal libraries/services).

**NFR-010**: Technical Documentation
- Comprehensive internal technical documentation shall be maintained, including system architecture diagrams (as per Appendix B), data models (ERDs), API specifications (OpenAPI), sequence diagrams for key workflows, and deployment procedures.
- Documentation shall be version-controlled (e.g., in a Git repository alongside code or in a dedicated wiki) and kept up-to-date with system changes through regular reviews and integration with the development process.
- Developer onboarding guides and module-specific documentation should facilitate rapid understanding and contribution for new team members.

**NFR-011**: Testability
- System components shall be designed to be easily testable at unit, integration, and end-to-end levels.

**Diagram Description:**
The architecture depicts user traffic flowing through Cloudflare CDN and a Load Balancer (Nginx) to frontend applications (Web, Mobile) and an API Gateway (Nginx). These interact with the Odoo 18+ Backend via REST APIs for business logic (user management, billing, content management), which is composed of standard and custom Odoo modules. Odoo is integrated primarily via asynchronous message queues (RabbitMQ) for updates from the AI processing pipeline, minimizing its role in the real-time critical path for creative generation. The Odoo backend triggers the n8n Workflow Engine (via RabbitMQ job messages). n8n acts as an orchestration layer, managing AI creative generation and image processing jobs on a GPU-accelerated AI processing cluster (managed by Kubernetes). RabbitMQ handles job distribution. The n8n/AI layer communicates results (e.g., samples, completion notifications) to the Notification Service (which then updates frontends/mobile apps via WebSockets) and updates Odoo asynchronously. Persistent data is stored in a PostgreSQL 16+ database, with generated assets and user uploads in MinIO Object Storage. Redis is used for caching, session data, and as a Pub/Sub mechanism for the Notification Service.

### 5.2 Component Architecture

#### 5.2.1 Frontend Components
- **Web Application**: React 19+ (or latest stable at development start) with TypeScript, utilizing standard JWT libraries (e.g., `jwt-decode`, `axios` interceptors for token management).
- **Mobile Apps**: Flutter 3.19+ (or latest stable at development start) with Dart and native platform integration, utilizing standard JWT libraries and SQLite (via Drift/Moor) for local offline storage.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Core web application will be designed as a PWA, providing offline-capable mobile web experience with service workers for caching key assets and data, enabling basic read access and functionality when offline.

#### 5.2.2 Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: Nginx with rate limiting, authentication (JWT validation), request routing, and potentially basic request/response transformation.
- **Business Logic**: Odoo 18+ (or latest stable at development start) utilizing a combination of out-of-the-box modules (e.g., Sales for subscriptions, CRM for user data, Website for basic CMS, Helpdesk for support tickets) and custom-developed modules for specialized platform logic (e.g., brand kit management, workbench organization, credit system logic). Integration with other services will be primarily through REST APIs exposed or consumed by Odoo for initial request processing, and asynchronous messaging (RabbitMQ) for decoupling high-volume, non-real-time tasks and updates from the AI pipeline from core Odoo transactions. Performance implications of Odoo's involvement in any remaining synchronous paths will be continuously monitored and optimized.
- **AI Processing Orchestration**: n8n workflows will define the sequence of AI tasks (e.g., prompt engineering, model selection, image post-processing). n8n will trigger jobs on a GPU processing cluster managed by Kubernetes (with NVIDIA GPU Operator or equivalent). Custom n8n nodes may be developed to interface directly with GPU-accelerated libraries, submit jobs to Kubernetes, or interact with third-party AI APIs. Communication will be via RabbitMQ job queue messages. The n8n layer will also facilitate communication of results to the Notification Service and Odoo (asynchronously).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16+ (or latest stable at development start) with read replicas for scaling read-heavy operations and streaming replication for high availability and disaster recovery.
- **Caching**: Redis for session management, content caching (e.g., frequently accessed templates, user preferences), rate limiting counters, and as a Pub/Sub mechanism for real-time notifications.
- **Storage**: MinIO S3-compatible object storage cluster for storing user-uploaded assets, generated creatives, and potentially large static assets.
- **Job Queue Management**: RabbitMQ for managing AI generation job queues between Odoo, n8n, and the GPU cluster, ensuring reliable, asynchronous task processing.
- **Notification Service**: A dedicated lightweight service (e.g., FastAPI with Python, or Node.js with Socket.IO) managing WebSockets for real-time updates to frontends (e.g., generation progress, collaboration updates, new notifications), consuming messages from RabbitMQ or Redis Pub/Sub.

### 5.3 Data Flow Architecture

#### 5.3.1 Creative Generation Pipeline
1.  User submits creative request (prompt, images, parameters) via web/mobile app or API.
2.  Request is received by the API Gateway, authenticated, and routed to the Odoo backend.
3.  Odoo backend validates the request, checks user subscription/credits, retrieves relevant user info (brand kit, preferences), and prepares job parameters.
4.  Odoo backend publishes a job message to a specific RabbitMQ exchange/queue to trigger an n8n workflow, passing the request parameters (including user ID, request ID, input data references).
5.  The n8n workflow orchestrates the AI generation:
    a.  n8n worker consumes the job from RabbitMQ.
    b.  n8n workflow executes steps: data pre-processing, AI model selection, interaction with AI models (either custom models on the GPU cluster or third-party APIs via secure gateways).
    c.  For custom models, n8n submits a job to Kubernetes, which schedules a pod on a GPU-enabled worker node. The worker node pulls the containerized AI model and processes the data.
    d.  AI models generate multiple sample variations.
6.  Samples (low-resolution previews) are returned by the n8n/AI layer. n8n stores sample metadata/references and informs the Notification Service (e.g., via a RabbitMQ message to a dedicated queue or Redis Pub/Sub). The Notification Service then updates the user's frontend directly via WebSockets for quick user selection. Odoo backend is updated asynchronously with sample metadata for record-keeping, analytics, and credit deduction for samples.
7.  User selects a sample for high-resolution generation via the frontend. This action is sent to the Odoo backend, which then triggers another n8n workflow (or a specific part of the existing workflow) via RabbitMQ, referencing the selected sample and desired output parameters.
8.  n8n orchestrates the high-resolution generation job on the GPU cluster, similar to step 5c.
9.  The final high-resolution asset is generated and stored in MinIO object storage by the AI worker or n8n.
10. n8n updates the generation status, stores final asset metadata (including MinIO path) in PostgreSQL (potentially via an Odoo API call or directly if architected so), informs the Notification Service for user notification (WebSockets/push notification), and Odoo is updated asynchronously with final asset details and credit deduction for final generation/export.

#### 5.3.2 Collaboration Flow
1. User A initiates an edit on a shared project. Changes are captured by the frontend.
2. For real-time collaboration, changes are sent via WebSocket connection (managed by the Notification Service) to other connected collaborators (User B, User C) on the same project.
3. Conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) libraries (e.g., Yjs) are used on the client-side and potentially on a mediating server component (part of Notification Service or a dedicated collaboration service) to merge changes and resolve conflicts automatically where possible. The state is periodically persisted.
4. Significant changes or consolidated states are persisted to PostgreSQL (e.g., project data, comments). Asset updates are versioned in MinIO object storage.
5. Change history (diffs or snapshots) is maintained in PostgreSQL for auditing and potential rollback.
6. Offline edits (REQ-019.1) are queued locally on the device and synced/merged using CRDT mechanisms upon reconnection.

### 7.5 Data Retention Policies
Data retention policies will be implemented to comply with legal requirements (e.g., GDPR's storage limitation principle, CCPA) and manage storage costs effectively. These policies are integral business rules of the platform.
- **User Account Data (REQ-001, 7.1.1)**:
    - Active accounts: Retained indefinitely while the account is active and has a valid subscription (if applicable) or recent login activity (e.g., login within the last 24 months).
    - Inactive accounts (no login for 24 consecutive months for Free users; 36 months for paying users post-subscription expiry): Users will be notified 90 days and 30 days prior to action. If no activity, account data may be anonymized or deleted, subject to legal holds or ongoing billing disputes.
    - Deleted accounts (user-initiated via GDPR Article 17 request, or system-initiated due to policy violation): Personal data will be permanently deleted or fully anonymized within 30 days of request processing or final decision, except where required for legal obligations (e.g., financial transaction records retained for 7 years) or security incident investigation.
- **User-Uploaded Assets (part of 7.4.1)**:
    - Free Users: Retained for 12 months after last access to the specific asset or 12 months of account inactivity, whichever is shorter. Users will be notified before deletion.
    - Pro/Team/Enterprise Users: Retained as long as the subscription is active. Upon subscription termination (and after any applicable grace period, e.g., 90 days), assets may be scheduled for deletion unless the user resubscribes or exports their data. Users will be notified.
- **AI-Generated Creatives (7.2.1, 7.4.1)**:
    - Samples (REQ-008): Retained for 30 days unless selected for final generation or explicitly saved by the user. Unselected/unsaved samples may be purged earlier to manage storage.
    - Final Generations:
        - Free Users: Retained for 12 months, linked to user-uploaded asset policy and account activity.
        - Pro/Team/Enterprise Users: Retained as long as the subscription is active and the asset is part of an active project. Policy upon subscription termination mirrors that of user-uploaded assets.
- **Version Histories (REQ-011, 7.2.1)**:
    - Retained for the lifetime of the parent asset for Pro/Team/Enterprise users.
    - Free users may have limited version history (e.g., last 3 versions or versions created within the last 30 days).
- **Usage Logs (7.3.1)**:
    - Detailed logs for billing, credit tracking, and core analytics: Retained for 24 months for active users, potentially longer in aggregated/anonymized form for trend analysis.
    - Logs related to financial transactions: Retained for 7 years or as per legal requirements.
- **Audit Trails (Security Logs, System Logs)**: Retained for a minimum of 12 months, or longer if required by compliance standards (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR investigation needs). Access to these logs will be strictly controlled.
- **Backup Data**: Backups will be retained according to a defined schedule (e.g., daily backups retained for 30 days, weekly for 90 days, monthly for 1 year) to meet RPO/RTO (NFR-003). Backup retention itself will comply with data minimization principles for older backups.
- Users will be provided with tools to manage their data and request deletion in accordance with applicable privacy laws and platform Terms of Service.

Focus on business logic, utility functions, and individual components.
- **Integration Tests**: For all API endpoints (PyTest with HTTP client libraries, Postman/Newman), service-to-service communications (e.g., Odoo to n8n, n8n to AI services, services to RabbitMQ), and database interactions. Mock external dependencies where appropriate.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: For critical user journeys (e.g., registration, subscription, creative generation workflow, collaboration) using frameworks like Cypress or Playwright for web, and Appium or Flutter integration tests for mobile.
- **Performance Testing**: Load, stress, and soak testing using tools like k6, JMeter, or Locust to validate NFRs (NFR-001, NFR-002) under various conditions. Performance baselines established and monitored over time.
- **Security Testing**: Automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Snyk) integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Dependency vulnerability scanning.
- **Contract Testing**: For microservices, ensuring that services can communicate with each other correctly (e.g., using Pact).

#### 10.1.2 Quality Gates
**QA-002**: Strict release criteria for production deployments, as an organizational policy.
- All critical and high-priority bugs (as defined by a severity/priority matrix) identified during testing phases must be resolved and verified.
- Successful completion of all automated test suites (unit, integration, E2E) with coverage targets met.
- Performance benchmarks (NFR-001, NFR-002, KPI-004) met in a staging environment that mirrors production.
- Security scan results (SAST, DAST, vulnerability scans) cleared with no high/critical vulnerabilities outstanding. Any medium vulnerabilities must have a documented risk assessment and mitigation plan.
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) verified through automated tools (e.g., Axe) and manual checks for key user flows.
- Successful completion of User Acceptance Testing (QA-004) for major releases or significant feature changes.
- Documentation (user-facing and technical) updated to reflect changes.
- Rollback plan tested and verified.

### 10.2 Monitoring and Alerting

- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Tools like Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for dashboards. For deeper insights, consider integrating APM solutions like Datadog, New Relic, or self-hosted options like OpenTelemetry with Jaeger/Zipkin for distributed tracing.
- **Centralized Logging & Error Tracking**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki for log aggregation and analysis. Sentry, Rollbar, or similar for application error tracking and alerting. Alerts managed by Prometheus Alertmanager and Grafana Alerting, or integrated alerting features of chosen APM/error tracking tools.
- **User Experience Monitoring (Real User Monitoring - RUM)**: Client-side error tracking, core web vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) monitoring, and mobile app performance monitoring (crash rates, ANR rates).
- **Infrastructure Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of CPU, memory, disk I/O and space, network bandwidth and latency, GPU utilization and temperature (via Prometheus Node Exporter, NVIDIA DCGM exporter, and other relevant exporters).
- **Business Process Monitoring**: Tracking key business metrics and workflows (e.g., user registration success rates, payment completion rates, AI generation pipeline throughput and error rates) through dashboards and alerts.

**QA-003.1**: Alerting Thresholds and Procedures
- Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) thresholds shall be defined for critical system metrics, including but not limited to:
    - KPIs from Section 12 (e.g., API response time exceeding 95th percentile target for >5 mins, AI generation success rate dropping below 95% over a 1-hour window).
    - NFRs from Section 4 (e.g., uptime deviations, high error rates for creative generation > X%, RPO/RTO at risk during DR drills).
    - Critical error conditions (e.g., payment processing failures > X% in Y minutes, Odoo integration errors, n8n workflow failures > Z%, RabbitMQ queue depth exceeding Y messages for critical queues, database connection pool exhaustion).
    - Resource saturation (e.g., CPU/GPU utilization > 85% sustained for Z minutes, disk space < 10% free on critical volumes, memory swapping).
- **Escalation Matrix**: A documented escalation matrix (organizational policy) will define:
    - Alert severities (e.g., P1-Critical/System Down, P2-High/Service Impaired, P3-Medium/Warning, P4-Low/Informational).
    - Notification channels for each severity (e.g., PagerDuty/Opsgenie integrations with Alertmanager/Grafana for P1/P2, Slack/MS Teams for P2/P3, email for P4).
    - Responsible on-call teams/individuals for different types of alerts (e.g., SRE, backend dev, AI ops).
    - Expected acknowledgment and resolution times per severity (SLAs/SLOs).
    - Standard operating procedures (SOPs) or runbooks linked directly from alerts for common critical issues, guiding initial triage and remediation steps.
- Regular review and tuning of alert thresholds to minimize false positives and alert fatigue.

### 10.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
**QA-004**: Beta testing program and internal UAT
- **Internal UAT**: Conducted by internal stakeholders (product, marketing, support teams) on a staging environment before any major release.
- **Closed Beta Program**: For significant new features or major platform versions, invite approximately 100-200 selected users representing different target user segments (Free, Pro, Team, potential Enterprise) to a production-like environment or early access production.
- **Feature-Specific Testing Groups**: Smaller, focused groups for testing niche or advanced functionalities.
- **Systematic Feedback Collection**: Utilize in-app feedback tools (e.g., Hotjar, UserVoice), dedicated beta forums or communication channels (e.g., Discord, Slack), and structured surveys to gather qualitative and quantitative feedback.
- **Feedback Prioritization**: A clear process for triaging, categorizing, and prioritizing feedback (e.g., linking feedback to JIRA issues, using a voting system).
- **Performance and Usability Validation**: Beta testers specifically tasked to evaluate performance, usability, and overall user experience in real-world scenarios and on diverse devices/networks.
- Exit criteria for beta program (business rule): e.g., minimum number of active testers, specific number of critical issues resolved, positive trend in satisfaction scores.

## 11. Deployment Strategy

### 11.1 Infrastructure Requirements

#### 11.1.1 Hosting Environment
**DEP-001**: Self-hosted dedicated server infrastructure (initial phase, with potential for hybrid cloud in future)
- **Web Servers / API Gateway**: Minimum 3x Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (e.g., 4-8 vCPU, 16-32GB RAM, SSD), scalable, running Nginx (for load balancing, reverse proxy, API gateway functions).
- **Database Server (PostgreSQL)**: 1x Primary Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (e.g., 8-16 vCPU, 32-64GB RAM, high IOPS SSDs in RAID configuration) for PostgreSQL 16+ (or latest stable at development start), with at least 1x dedicated read replica/failover instance with similar specs in a different availability zone (rack/power supply).
- **AI Processing Cluster (Kubernetes Managed)**:
    - Initial deployment with a minimum of 2-4x high-performance GPU servers (e.g., equipped with NVIDIA RTX 4090, H100, or equivalent future generations like Blackwell series) for launch, initial user load, and performance baselining. Each server with substantial RAM (e.g., 128GB+) and fast local NVMe storage.
    - Orchestrated by Kubernetes (e.g., K3s, RKE2, or full K8s) with NVIDIA GPU Operator and cluster-autoscaler functionality (for scaling node pools if using cloud-bursting or dynamically provisioned bare metal in later phases).
    - Designed for horizontal auto-scaling of AI processing workloads (pods/deployments via HPA), to utilize available and newly provisioned GPU resources to meet throughput requirements (NFR-002), potentially scaling to dozens or hundreds of GPUs. This "auto-scaling" refers to the orchestration capability to dynamically assign jobs to available resources and integrate newly provisioned hardware, acknowledging that physical hardware scaling involves procurement lead times (see DEP-002).
    - GPU resources will be managed using tools like NVIDIA DCGM for monitoring and Kubernetes device plugins.
- **Object Storage (MinIO)**: MinIO cluster with minimum 3 nodes, providing 10TB initial usable capacity, scalable, on dedicated Ubuntu 22.04 LTS servers with large HDDs/SSDs.
- **Odoo Server(s)**: 1-2x Dedicated Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instances (e.g., 4-8 vCPU, 16-32GB RAM), sized according to Odoo's recommendations and anticipated load, separate from web servers.
- **n8n Server(s)**: 1-2x Dedicated Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instances for running n8n workflows (e.g., 2-4 vCPU, 8-16GB RAM), potentially containerized and managed by Kubernetes if scaling needs grow.
- **Caching Server(s) (Redis)**: 1-2x Dedicated Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instances for Redis (e.g., 2-4 vCPU, 8-16GB RAM), configured for persistence and potentially clustering/sentinel for HA.
- **Message Queue Server(s) (RabbitMQ)**: 1-2x Dedicated Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instances for RabbitMQ (e.g., 2-4 vCPU, 8-16GB RAM), configured in a cluster for HA.
- **Notification Service Server(s)**: 1-2x Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instances for the FastAPI-based Notification Service (e.g., 2-4 vCPU, 8-16GB RAM), scalable.
- All servers will have redundant power supplies and network connections where possible.

#### 11.1.2 Cost Optimization Strategy
**DEP-002**: Infrastructure cost management for self-hosted environment
- For self-hosted hardware, evaluate long-term hardware leases versus purchase amortization strategies to achieve cost benefits over on-demand acquisition. Factor in maintenance and operational overhead.
- Efficient workload scheduling and resource pooling within the self-hosted GPU cluster (managed by Kubernetes) for batch AI processing to maximize utilization and cost-effectiveness. This includes optimizing job batching, leveraging GPU time-slicing or Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) features where appropriate and supported by hardware/workloads. The strategy must also account for hardware procurement/leasing lead times by planning for capacity increases in advance of projected demand or maintaining a strategic buffer of pre-provisioned capacity, balancing cost optimization with the agility required to meet scaling needs for GPU resources.
- CDN integration (Cloudflare) for reducing origin server load, bandwidth costs, and improving global content delivery performance.
- Implement automatic scaling based on demand patterns for components designed to auto-scale (e.g., AI processing workers, web application servers, Notification Service workers) to match resources to actual load, avoiding over-provisioning during off-peak hours.
- Regularly review resource utilization and optimize instance sizes/counts for all services.
- Explore energy-efficient hardware and data center options if applicable.

### 11.2 Deployment Pipeline

#### 11.2.1 CI/CD Process
**DEP-003**: Automated and secure deployment pipeline (organizational policy)
- GitLab CI/CD or GitHub Actions for orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline.
- Automated build processes for all components (frontend, backend services, mobile apps, AI models if applicable).
- Automated testing stages: unit tests, integration tests, static code analysis (SonarQube or similar), security scans (SAST, dependency checking) triggered on every commit/merge request.
- Containerization of applications (Docker) and storing images in a private container registry (e.g., GitLab Container Registry, Harbor).
- Blue-green deployment or canary releases for zero-downtime updates to production environments, managed by Kubernetes or custom deployment scripts.
- Database migration automation using tools like Flyway or Liquibase, integrated into the deployment pipeline and version-controlled.
- Automated rollback procedures for failed deployments, triggered by health check failures or manual intervention.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices using Ansible (DEP-004.1) integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for environment provisioning and configuration updates.
- Secure handling of secrets (API keys, passwords) within the CI/CD pipeline using tools like HashiCorp Vault or platform-specific secret management.

#### 11.2.2 Environment Management
**DEP-004**: Consistent and isolated multi-environment setup
- **Development**: Local developer setups (e.g., Docker Compose) and a shared development integration environment.
- **Staging**: A dedicated environment that mirrors the production setup as closely as possible in terms of infrastructure, configuration, and data (anonymized). Used for UAT, performance testing, and final validation before production deployment.
- **Production**: High-availability configuration as described in hosting environment (DEP-001), strictly controlled access.
- **Testing**: Potentially dynamic environments spun up on demand for specific automated test runs (e.g., E2E tests against a full stack).
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: Geographically separate DR site with data replication (as per NFR-004) and a documented, regularly tested failover plan. The DR environment should be capable of running critical services within the RTO.
- Consistent configuration across environments managed by IaC (DEP-004.1), with environment-specific parameters managed securely.

**DEP-004.1**: Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Ansible shall be used to automate the provisioning, configuration, and ongoing management of all self-hosted Linux servers and their software stacks (OS, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Odoo, n8n, MinIO, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes cluster components, AI tools, monitoring agents like Prometheus exporters).
- Ansible playbooks and roles will be version-controlled in Git (Infrastructure-as-Code) and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (DEP-003) to ensure consistency, enable automated updates, track changes, and facilitate environment recreation across all environments (dev, staging, prod, DR).
- Secrets management (e.g., database passwords, API keys) will be handled using Ansible Vault or integration with HashiCorp Vault, not stored in plain text in Git repositories.

### 11.3 Monitoring and Maintenance
**DEP-005**: Comprehensive operational monitoring, logging, and maintenance (organizational policy)
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus for collecting time-series metrics from all system components (using official and custom exporters like node_exporter, postgres_exporter, rabbitmq_exporter, nginx_exporter, redis_exporter, jmx_exporter for Odoo/Java if applicable, n8n metrics, DCGM exporter for GPUs, Odoo-specific metrics via custom exporters if needed).
- **Visualization and Alerting**: Grafana for dashboards visualizing key metrics and trends. Alerting based on Prometheus metrics managed by Prometheus Alertmanager or Grafana Alerting, with alert rules defined as per QA-003.1.
- **Log Aggregation and Analysis**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki for centralized log aggregation from all applications and servers. Beats (Filebeat, Metricbeat) or Fluentd/Fluent Bit will be used for log shipping.
    - **Logging Strategy**:
        - **Standardized Log Format**: Structured JSON format for all application and system logs to facilitate easier parsing, searching, and analysis.
        - **Correlation IDs**: Unique correlation IDs (trace IDs) will be generated at the entry point of a request (e.g., API Gateway) and propagated through all services involved in processing that request to enable distributed tracing and simplify debugging across microservices (potentially using OpenTelemetry libraries and collectors).
        - **Critical Events & Data Points**: Key events to log include API requests/responses (headers, status codes, timings, anonymized payloads where appropriate), authentication attempts (success/failure), errors and exceptions with stack traces, business transactions (e.g., subscription changes, creative generations start/end, credit deductions), AI model invocations (model name, version, duration), and significant state changes. Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be used appropriately and configurable per environment.
        - **Log Retention**: Log retention policies within the ELK stack/Loki will be defined based on operational needs, compliance requirements (e.g., security audit logs for 12+ months), and storage costs (e.g., hot storage for 7-14 days, warm for 30-90 days, cold/archived for longer periods).
- **Maintenance Procedures**: Documented procedures for regular security updates, OS patching, and software upgrades, managed and automated via Ansible (DEP-004.1). Scheduled maintenance windows will be communicated to users in advance (as per NFR-003).
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automated daily backups of databases and critical configuration data, stored securely offsite. Regular testing of restore procedures.

### 11.4 Transition Strategy
