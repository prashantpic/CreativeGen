# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Content Moderation Check during AI Generation
  Illustrates how content moderation policies and mechanisms are applied during the AI creative generation process to identify and manage harmful, illegal, or infringing content.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To document the platform's commitment to content safety and compliance with legal/platform terms regarding generated content.

  #### .5. Type
  SecurityFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - svc-n8n-workflow-engine
  - ext-ai-openai
  - comp-k8s-cluster
  - svc-odoo-backend
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - n8n workflow receives AI generation request (prompt and/or input images).
  - Pre-generation check: n8n (or Odoo before job dispatch) may check prompt against a deny-list or use a simple text classifier.
  - AI Model (e.g., OpenAI, custom model on K8s) generates content.
  - Post-generation check: n8n receives generated content (image/text).
  - n8n passes content to an AI-based content safety filter (either a dedicated step, a third-party API, or built-in feature of the AI model provider like OpenAI's safety system).
  - If content is flagged as potentially harmful/illegal/infringing:
  -   - n8n workflow logs the issue.
  -   - Generation may be halted or the specific problematic sample discarded.
  -   - User may be notified with a generic message (REQ-007.1).
  -   - For severe/repeated violations, Odoo Backend might be updated to flag user account.
  -   - A manual review process might be triggered for borderline cases (details TBD in operational policy).
  - If content passes moderation, n8n proceeds with the workflow (e.g., sending samples to user).
  
  #### .8. Related Feature Ids
  
  - Section 2.5 (Content Moderation)
  - REQ-007.1
  - NFR-006
  
  #### .9. Domain

  #### .10. Metadata

  - **Priority:** High
