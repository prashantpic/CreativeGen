"""
Service for monitoring custom model performance and health.

This service provides interfaces to external monitoring systems (like Prometheus)
and logging pipelines. It's responsible for fetching performance metrics,
checking for model drift, and logging inference requests/responses for
auditing and retraining purposes.

NOTE: This is a placeholder implementation. A real system would integrate
with actual monitoring client libraries and logging infrastructure.
