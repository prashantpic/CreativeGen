        Applies a list of offline changes to a session's document state.

        This method leverages the inherent conflict resolution capabilities of CRDTs (Yjs)
        by sequentially applying the updates. For most structural and text edits, Yjs
        handles merging automatically and deterministically.

        Future enhancements could involve more complex business logic here if automatic
        merging is insufficient for certain types of changes, potentially flagging
        conflicts for manual user review.

            session (CollaborationSession): The collaboration session, including its
                                            last known document state.
