# This file path seems to be from a different service (collaboration) based on the input prompt.
# The SDS and file structure provided are for the `aigeneration` service.
# As per the instructions to strictly follow the provided SDS for the `aigeneration` service,
# creating a file for a `collaboration` service is out of scope.
# If this file were part of the `aigeneration` service, it would be generated.
# For now, I will add a placeholder indicating this discrepancy.

# This file path belongs to the Collaboration Service, not the AI Generation Orchestration Service.
# The code generation task is scoped to the AI Generation Orchestration Service based on the provided SDS.
# Therefore, the source code for this file is not generated as part of this task.
